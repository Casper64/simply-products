## Inkdrop

> DISCLAIMER:

the notes page layout is heavily inspired by [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/) and all of the components in this folder for rendering the markdown and the editor come straight from his [github page](https://github.com/craftzdog/electron-markdown-editor-tutorial) (with some minor adjustments). Checkout out his [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxBis8EgoAg) if you want more explanation or simply browse through the code on github.

I very much thank him for making his code open source under the MIT license.

I do not claim to own this code and all credit should go to Takuya Matsuyama.
